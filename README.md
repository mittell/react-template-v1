# React from Scratch - v1

A React App Template from Scratch.

## About

After spending several months learning React and using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), I decided to dig a little deeper and work out how to set up a React application and Development Environment from scratch.

This repo will contain the first version of my own custom template for building React applications.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, and make sure to run the commands mentioned below from your terminal within the root project directory.

### Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is installed, and npm is up to date:

    npm@latest -g

Run the provided setup script:

    npm run setup

Build and run the compiled version with the build and start scripts:

    npm run build
    npm run start
